> ChatGPT: The ancient Greek word you are referring to is "dracontion" (δρακόντιον), which means "serpent bridge". This term was used to describe a type of bridge that was built using the bodies of snakes or serpents, either real or mythical. The concept of a serpent bridge was likely inspired by the legend of the Lernaean Hydra, a many-headed serpent that was slain by the hero Heracles (Hercules in Roman mythology) as one of his twelve labors.
